# Problem Statement
Build a recommendation engine for CareemNow users placing an order for delivery.
Details

CareemNow is a key player in the food delivery industry in major markets. We need to reduce friction and decision time for users to place their orders.
Create a solution that recommends merchants to users based on their previous orders, search history and ratings. This will allow us to leverage the power of default, increase order throughput and customer satisfaction. 
Hints

- Be creative, think out-of-the-box, and optimize for simplicity.
- You can pick just one of the 3 criteria for recommendations to simplify your solution. There may also be ways to solve both problems with the same solution.
- Break the problem down into sub-problems so you can think through them easily. For instance:
   - How does a customer place an order? How can we reduce friction in time-to-order?
   - How does Careem know about preferences? If we don't know, how do we make an educated guess?
   - How does matching, recommending, and validation take place?
   - How is payment handled? What are success criteria?
